# Inf122-BoardGames-Client
Client for the Inf122 board games final project

## Usage

This is a SPA (single page app) and so does not come with a server.

However, `http-server` is a dev dependency for your convenience.

You can start this bundled server using `npm start`

Depending how hardcore we get, there may be a build step involved (webpack, babel, etc)... but not yet.
